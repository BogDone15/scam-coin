    Terms of Use vs. Terms of Service: what’s the difference between Terms and Conditions, Terms of
    Service
    and Terms of Use?
    In general, there is no legal difference. Terms and conditions, terms of service and terms of use
    are
    names all used to refer to the same document. The particular
    name used at any point in time is simply a matter of preference.

    1. Agreement Terms
   </h3>
   <p class="news__text">
    This Agreement regulates the relationship between the Neogara Affiliate Network (Neogara) and the
    affiliates of the network (Affiliates). This is the main document
    for cooperation between the Parties.
    Can I use a terms and conditions template?
    Despite how simple they appear, terms and conditions are meant to meet incredibly complex and highly
    specific scenarios. Because each terms and conditions
    document is a legally binding contract that is meant to protect you, the business owner, it’s
    imperative
    that the document matches your specific business processes,
    model, and remains up-to-date with the various laws referenced in its contents. Templates simply
    cannot
    do this, therefore, we strongly suggest that you avoid using
    templates. Read our extended answer to this question here.
