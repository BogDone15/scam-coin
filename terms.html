    TERMS OF CONDITIONS
   </h2>
   <p class="terms__text">
    This Agreement regulates the relationship between the Neogara Affiliate Network (Neogara) and the affiliates of the
    network (Affiliates). This is the main document
    for cooperation between the Parties.
    Can I use a terms and conditions template?
    Despite how simple they appear, terms and conditions are meant to meet incredibly complex and highly specific
    scenarios. Because each terms and conditions
    document is a legally binding contract that is meant to protect you, the business owner, it’s imperative that the
    document matches your specific business processes,
    model, and remains up-to-date with the various laws referenced in its contents. Templates simply cannot do this,
    therefore, we strongly suggest that you avoid using
    templates. Read our extended answer to this question here.
    <br><br>
    Terms of Use vs. Terms of Service: what’s the difference between Terms and Conditions, Terms of Service and Terms of
    Use?
    In general, there is no legal difference. Terms and conditions, terms of service and terms of use are names all used
    to refer to the same document. The particular
    name used at any point in time is simply a matter of preference.
