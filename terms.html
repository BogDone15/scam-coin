     TERMS OF CONDITIONS
    </h2>
    <p class="terms__text">
     This Agreement regulates the relationship between the Neogara Affiliate Network (Neogara) and the affiliates of the
     network (Affiliates). This is the main document
     for cooperation between the Parties.
     Can I use a terms and conditions template?
     Despite how simple they appear, terms and conditions are meant to meet incredibly complex and highly specific
     scenarios. Because each terms and conditions
     document is a legally binding contract that is meant to protect you, the business owner, it’s imperative that the
     document matches your specific business processes,
     model, and remains up-to-date with the various laws referenced in its contents. Templates simply cannot do this,
     therefore, we strongly suggest that you avoid using
     templates. Read our extended answer to this question here.

     Terms of Use vs. Terms of Service: what’s the difference between Terms and Conditions, Terms of Service and Terms
     of
     Use?
     In general, there is no legal difference. Terms and conditions, terms of service and terms of use are names all
     used
     to refer to the same document. The particular
     name used at any point in time is simply a matter of preference.
